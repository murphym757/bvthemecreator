# README

This app was created to simply serve as a simple theme selector. Using the Dom, I created 6 unique themes (all with sweets influenced names). This code will serve a theme selector for future projects/apps. Simply press any of the 6 buttons on the screen to see a specific theme.

Languages and Processes used to create this web app:

* Rails (5.0)

* HTML 5

* CSS 3

* JavaScript (ES6) & (DOM Methods)

* Heroku

* GitHub
